**Description**
A clear and concise description of what the user story is about.

**Priority**
This will help us understand which stories you need to tackle first. Could use different types of priorization like MoSCoW, iron triangle, by value etc.

**Estimate**
Estimate the story complexity and/or time to develop.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Scenario: the name for the behaviour that will be described
- Given:  the beginning state of the scenario
- When: specific action that the user makes
- Then: the outcome of the action in “When”
- And: used to continue any of three previous statements

When it is hard to fit in the Given/When/Then structure, you could use the rules-oriented structure.

**Additional context**
Add any other context like references, screenshots, etc.

**Linked design**
- Zeplin → ...
- Mockup → [Screenshot](...)

**Linked issues**
- Link any related issues.
